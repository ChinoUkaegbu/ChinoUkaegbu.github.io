# Assignment 1: 30MFF Website

**Description**

The task was to debut our 30 Minute Film Festival videos. I wanted the website to be very user friendly, organized and to highlight the important aspects of the presentation. I tried to pay attention to font choices and colour choices and even certain placements of content on the screen to convey the idea I had in my head. 

**Implementation**
For this website, I wanted to go with a very relaxed, muted vibe. The major element of the website was the video and so I made sure to put it on the home page.
After designing the wireframe and putting finishing touches to the general outline of the website I had in my head, I went on to implement it. I first picked a color palette because I knew that would play a huge part in the vibe the website was giving off. After some research, I decided to go with [this color palette](https://coolors.co/22223b-4a4e69-9a8c98-c9ada7-f2e9e4) because it had a more muted, relaxed vibe which was what I was going for.

I then decided to create a sort of grouping in my head for how I would design the pages. I noted the styles that I found were similar between some pages and used that as a factor to decide which pages I would design first, for instance, I had to design the about us page which had text on pictures before I could design the contact us page because it also had the text on image feature but it was way less complicated than the contact us page.

After that, I got into the actual implementation in HTML and did some CSS implementation as well. I found that designing the wireframe before beginning the implementation was super helpful because I alredy knew where I wanted to place certain things onto the page and so I just had to focus on placing those things on the page.

After I had finished getting some content onto the page, I had to deal with positioning. That was a bit stressful, but I found that editing it using the developer tools really helped to clear some of my doubts instead of using the text editor and then having to save and then go back to reload the page. Also, whenever I wanted to make a big change to the code that was already working, I would copy it and save it into a backup file so I wouldn't lose my progress.

When I was finally threw with positioning, I decided to add some interactivity to the page, first in CSS before I moved on to Java. That was probably my favourite section to implement because I was already through with the basics so it was just a lot of experimenting and playing around with the code until I got the effects that I wanted.

When I completed the website, i then uploaded it unto github and then I ran into an issue with one of the fonts not showing but it turns out I just needed to make a few tweaks to get it to display.

**Reflection**
I was pleased with the implentation because it was quite close to what I had intended when I designed the wireframe. I had to leave out a few minor details but I was also able to include more concepts than I had visualized at first so that was really great. From this project, I've learnt that sometimes, just a line of code could distort the results ou had intended and so you really have to pay attention because sometimes the solution isn't as complex as we make it out to be. Overall, this was a really fun project to do and I was really proud of the final result.
